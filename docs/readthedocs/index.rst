Welcome to DART's documentation!
================================

DART (Dynamic Animation and Robotics Toolkit) is a collaborative, cross-platform, open-source library developed by the `Graphics Lab <http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~karenliu/Home.html>`_ and `Humanoid Robotics Lab <http://www.golems.org/>`_ at the `Georgia Institute of Technology <http://www.gatech.edu/>`_, with ongoing contributions from the `Personal Robotics Lab <http://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/>`_ at the `University of Washington <http://www.washington.edu/>`_ and the `Open Source Robotics Foundation <https://www.osrfoundation.org/>`_. It provides data structures and algorithms for kinematic and dynamic applications in robotics and computer animation. DART stands out due to its accuracy and stability, which are achieved through the use of generalized coordinates to represent articulated rigid body systems and the application of Featherstone's Articulated Body Algorithm to compute motion dynamics.
