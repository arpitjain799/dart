"The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a quick introduction to using "
"DART. We designed many hands-on exercises to make the learning effective "
"and fun. To follow along with this tutorial, first locate the tutorial "
"code in the directory: "
"[dart/tutorials](https://github.com/dartsim/dart/tree/release-5.1/tutorials)."
" For each of the four tutorials, we provide the skeleton code as the "
"starting point (e.g. "
"[tutorialMultiPendulum.cpp](https://github.com/dartsim/dart/blob/release-5.1/tutorials/tutorialMultiPendulum.cpp))"
" and the final code as the answer to the tutorial (e.g. "
"[tutorialMultiPendulum-"
"Finished.cpp](https://github.com/dartsim/dart/blob/release-5.1/tutorials"
"/tutorialMultiPendulum-Finished.cpp)). The examples are based on the APIs"
" of DART 5.0."
