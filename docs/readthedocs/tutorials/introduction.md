# Introduction

The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a quick introduction to
using DART. We designed many hands-on exercises to make the learning
effective and fun. To follow along with this tutorial, first locate
the tutorial code in the directory: [dart/tutorials](https://github.com/dartsim/dart/tree/release-5.1/tutorials). For each of the
four tutorials, we provide the skeleton code as the starting point
(e.g. [tutorialMultiPendulum.cpp](https://github.com/dartsim/dart/blob/release-5.1/tutorials/tutorialMultiPendulum.cpp)) and
the final code as the answer to the tutorial (e.g. [tutorialMultiPendulum-Finished.cpp](https://github.com/dartsim/dart/blob/release-5.1/tutorials/tutorialMultiPendulum-Finished.cpp)). The examples are based on the APIs of DART 5.0.
